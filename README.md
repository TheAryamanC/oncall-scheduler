# RAOD Scheduler

A real-time collaborative web application for Resident Assistant On-Duty scheduling at Northwestern University.

Notes:
   - Unavailable dates are respected as best as possible - except if everyone says 'not preferred' for a particular date, someone is randomly assigned
   - Preferred dates are prioritized as best as possible
   - Equal distribution of shift types are ensured as best as possible (max variance is 1)
